    abstract = { Ordering process of the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the two-dimensional triangular lattice is studied both by topological analysis of defects and by Monte Carlo simulation. It is shown that the order parameter space of this model is isomorphic to the three-dimensional rotation group SO(3) due to the inherent frustration effect. Homotopy analysis shows that the system bears a topologically stable point defect characterized by a two-valued topological quantum number and exhibits a phase transition driven by the dissociation of the vortices. A Monte Carlo study on the specific heat and the behavior of vortices strongly suggests the occurence of a Kosterlitz-Thouless-type phase transition. It is, however, argued that in contrast to the two-dimensional X Y model, the spin-correlation function decays exponentially even in the low-temperature phase. In order to distinguish the high- and low-temperature phases qualitatively, we introduce a “vorticity function” analogously to the Wilson loop in the quark-confinement problem in the lattice gauge theory. A discussion is made on possible interpretations of the experimental data for triangular lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnets. }

abstract = {The magnetic ordering of the S=2/3 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a rhombohedrally stacked triangular lattice LiCrO2 is studied by susceptibility, neutron diffraction and polarization analysis measurements using a single crystal. The temperature dependence of the susceptibility strongly suggests that a 120 degrees structure is established in each quasi-two-dimensional layer, which is parallel to the c plane. Assuming the 120 degrees structure in which magnetic moments are confined in a plane including the c axis because of an Ising-type anisotropy, neutron scattering shows that the magnetic ordering is a double-Q structure with non-equivalent wave numbers q=(1/3 1/3 0) and (-2/3 1/3 1/2). It is characterized by an alternating sequence of rotational direction of the 120 degrees structure along the c axis.}

abstract={Frustration refers to competition between different interactions that cannot be simultaneously satisfied---a familiar feature in many magnetic solids. Strong frustration leads to highly degenerate ground states and a large suppression of ordering by fluctuations. Key challenges in frustrated magnetism include the characterization of the fluctuating spin-liquid regime and determination of the mechanism of eventual order at lower temperature. Here, we study a model of a diamond-lattice antiferromagnet appropriate for numerous spinel materials. With sufficiently strong frustration, a massive ground-state degeneracy develops amongst spirals whose propagation wavevectors reside on a continuous two-dimensional `spiral surface' in momentum space. We argue that an important ordering mechanism is entropic splitting of the degenerate ground states, an elusive phenomenon called `order by disorder'. A broad spiral spin-liquid regime emerges at higher temperatures, where the underlying spiral surface can be directly revealed through spin correlations. We discuss the agreement between these predictions and the well-characterized spinel MnSc2S4.},

    abstract = { Recent experiment on a honeycomb-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet (AF) Bi 3 Mn 4 O 12 (NO 3 ) revealed a novel spin-liquid-like behavior down to low temperature, which was ascribed to the frustration effect due to the competition between the AF nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor interactions J 1 and J 2 . Motivated by the experiment, we study the ordering of the J 1 – J 2 frustrated classical Heisenberg AF on a honeycomb lattice both by a low-temperature expansion and a Monte Carlo simulation. The model has been known to possess a massive degeneracy of the ground state, which, however, might be lifted due to thermal fluctuations leading to a unique ordered state, the effect known as “order-by-disorder”. We find that the model exhibits an intriguing ordering behavior, particularly near the AF phase boundary. The energy scale of the order-by-disorder is suppressed there down to extremely low temperatures, giving rise to exotic spin-liquid states like a “ring-liquid” or a “pancake-liquid” state accompanied by the characteristic spin structure factor and the field-induced antiferromagnetism. We argue that the recent experimental data are explicable if the system is in such exotic spin-liquid states. }

The ac susceptibility and specific heat studies reveal that it undergoes an AFM transition at TN=10.2K rather than the spin-glass one. High-field magnetization at 4.2K exhibits a weak 1/3 magnetization step near ~16.5T indicative of the field-induced quantum phase transition behavior. The analysis of temperature dependence of ESR spectra suggests that the short-range antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlation appear at temperatures well above TN. Further high-field ESR measurement up to 25T at 4.2K shows a broad resonance line, and the obtained g value is 2.094±0.012. Combined with the magnetic susceptibility and specific heat, the magnetic state below TN is explained by an AFM long rang order or a well developed AFM short range order with small anisotropy.}

abstract={Fifty years after Anderson's resonating valence-bond proposal, the spin-1/2 triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet (TLHAF) remains the ultimate platform to explore highly entangled quantum spin states in proximity to magnetic order. Yb-based delafossites are ideal candidate TLHAF materials, which allow experimental access to the full range of applied in-plane magnetic fields. We perform a systematic neutron scattering study of CsYbSe2, first proving the Heisenberg character of the interactions and quantifying the second-neighbor coupling. We then measure the complex evolution of the excitation spectrum, finding extensive continuum features near the 120{\textdegree}-ordered state, throughout the 1/3-magnetization plateau and beyond this up to saturation. We perform cylinder matrix-product-state (MPS) calculations to obtain an unbiased numerical benchmark for the TLHAF and spectacular agreement with the experimental spectra. The measured and calculated longitudinal spectral functions reflect the role of multi-magnon bound and scattering states. These results provide valuable insight into unconventional field-induced spin excitations in frustrated quantum materials.},

abstract={The spiral spin liquid (SSL) is a highly degenerate state characterized by a continuous contour or surface in reciprocal space spanned by a spiral propagation vector. Although the SSL state has been predicted in a number of various theoretical models, very few materials are so far experimentally identified to host such a state. Via combined single-crystal wide-angle and small-angle neutron scattering, we report observation of the SSL in the quasi-two-dimensional delafossite-like AgCrSe2. We show that it is a very close realization of the ideal Heisenberg J1--J2--J3 frustrated model on the triangular lattice. By supplementing our experimental results with microscopic spin-dynamics simulations, we demonstrate how such exotic magnetic states are driven by thermal fluctuations and exchange frustration.},
